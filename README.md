# Backtracking Class Routine

This project is an assignment for the course of CSE-3203 of Department of CSE, University of Dhaka.
Given the assigned courses of the teachers for a specific semester and the free time slots for the teachers, the goal is to create all possible class routines for all the batches of the undergraduate program using the backtracking algorithm. There are various theory and lab courses consisting of different credit values which results to different class times. The input data is provided in an Excel file and the code is implemented in Python.

## How To Run

Since the code is in Python, you need to have Python installed on your system.
Python Installation Link: [Download Python | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

First download the files in a folder.
Navigate to the folder and create a Python virtual environment in [this way](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/)
After activation of the virtual environment, run:

- pip install pandas
- pip install openpyxl

Finally, run the **class_routine.py** file.
